![thumbnail](https://cdn.static.foo/fd_missing_textures/fd%20clothing.png)

While similar replacements exist, they are often not lore-friendly or miss prop textures entirely. This pack features full male and female fixes for missing/checkerboard textures, including over 900+ custom-made variations.

## 💾 Installation

Drag and drop the `fd_missing_textures` folder into your resources. The included **ydd and images** folders are optional extras; move them to your desktop or a safe place, as they do not need to be streamed.

Loading order in your `server.cfg`: 
```
ensure fd_missing_textures
ensure [clothing]
```

**Note:** if you don't have a subscription [https://portal.cfx.re/subscriptions/element-club](https://portal.cfx.re/subscriptions/element-club). then use `sv_maxclients 8` in your settings.cfg

##  🎨 Features:
* **Not a lazy recolor!** This pack focuses primarily on gang colors, followed by gradients, patterns, and multi-color designs. Significant detail work was put into the shoe textures.
* **BC7 Texture Compression.** No artifacts on dark clothing (DirectX 11 recommended).
* **Supersampled textures** (Upscaled → Cleaned → Resized to original size).
* **Some upscaled textures** (Low-res textures like shoes are upgraded from 256 to 512 px).
* **Inventory Images.** Includes 1300+ images for every texture variant. This covers all models - not just the retextured ones, ensuring a consistent look across your clothing menu or inventory.
* **Categorized folders** with Male/Female separation.
 *  **YDD files** included in a separate folder, so you can easily preview them with clothing tools or edit.
